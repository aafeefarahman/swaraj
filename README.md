# Swaraj: AI-Powered Government Portal Translator

**Bridging Bharat with Bharosa: Making Government Information Truly Accessible**

---

## **1. Project Overview / Abstract**

Swaraj is an **AI-powered Streamlit web application** designed to make official government content more accessible to Indian citizens in their **native languages**. It bridges the language divide by translating formal English text from government portals into regional languages such as **Hindi, Urdu, and Telugu**.

Many citizens face barriers accessing critical schemes, policies, and public notices due to **complex English language** on official portals. Swaraj solves this by providing **instant translations**, **voice accessibility**, and **easy-to-read content**, making governance truly inclusive.

---

## **2. Motivation / Purpose**

The motivation behind Swaraj is simple but powerful: **no citizen should be left behind because of language barriers**.

* **Inclusivity:** Millions of Indians rely on regional languages to access information.
* **Accessibility:** Many official websites are not user-friendly or readable for non-English speakers.
* **Empowerment:** By simplifying government content, citizens can **better understand policies, exercise rights, and access public services**.

> We envisioned a tool that not only translates but also speaks to the user, bringing government information closer to every corner of India.

* 💾 **Corpus Creation:** Builds regional language datasets for AI research and fine-tuning.
* 🧪 **Rapid Testing:** Fast prototyping and deployment using **Streamlit**.
* 🖥️ **Minimal UI:** Clean interface for effortless navigation.

---

## **4. Tech Stack**

Swaraj is built using modern tools for **reliability, speed, and scalability**:

* **Backend:** Python (NLP, translation, TTS/STT)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Libraries & APIs:**

  * `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` — for scraping web pages
  * `pandas` — data handling

  * Handled **timeouts** and **invalid URLs** gracefully.
  * Chunked long text into smaller segments for smooth translation.
* **Translation Improvements:**

  * Verified accuracy for Hindi, Urdu, Telugu manually.
  * Stored translations in structured CSV:

    ```csv
    title,english,hindi,urdu,telugu
    ```
* **Corpus Export Script:** Automated conversion of DB entries to text files for AI training.

  ```bash
  python export_corpus.py --output data/corpus_v1.txt
  ```

---

## **9. Deployment Guide**

### **Local Deployment**

1. Ensure Python 3.11+, virtual environment, and dependencies installed.
2. Run the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Access locally at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

### **Streamlit Cloud Deployment**

1. Push code to GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Login to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and connect the repo.
3. Configure Python 3.11 environment and `requirements.txt`.
4. Deploy and access via public URL.

---

## **10. Challenges Faced**

* Handling **dynamic content** on government portals (ads, inconsistent HTML).
* Chunking large texts for translation to avoid API errors.
* Ensuring **voice modules** worked offline (pyttsx3) and online (gTTS).
* Testing **local deployment reproducibility** across machines.

---

## **11. Future Work**

* Add **chatbot** summarization for pages.
* Extend **language support** beyond Hindi, Urdu, Telugu.
* Enhance **grammar correction** and **AI summarization**.
* Public cloud hosting with persistent database for citizens.
