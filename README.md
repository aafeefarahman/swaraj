# Swaraj: AI-Powered Government Portal Translator

**Bridging Bharat with Bharosa: Making Government Information Truly Accessible**

---

## **1. Project Overview / Abstract**

Swaraj is an **AI-powered Streamlit web application** designed to make official government content more accessible to Indian citizens in their **native languages**. It bridges the language divide by translating formal English text from government portals into regional languages such as **Hindi, Urdu, and Telugu**.

Many citizens face barriers accessing critical schemes, policies, and public notices due to **complex English language** on official portals. Swaraj solves this by providing **instant translations**, **voice accessibility**, and **easy-to-read content**, making governance truly inclusive.

## **2. Motivation / Purpose**

The motivation behind Swaraj is simple but powerful: **no citizen should be left behind because of language barriers**.

* **Inclusivity:** Millions of Indians rely on regional languages to access information.
* **Accessibility:** Many official websites are not user-friendly or readable for non-English speakers.
* **Empowerment:** By simplifying government content, citizens can **better understand policies, exercise rights, and access public services**.

> We envisioned a tool that not only translates but also speaks to the user, bringing government information closer to every corner of India.
